# I am pleased to share some of the projects I developed in my free time. These projects are part of my ongoing learning process as a new programmer working with the C language. I hope these examples demonstrate my progress and commitment to mastering programming concepts. Notably, I completed these projects entirely on my phone, without using a laptop, showcasing my resourcefulness and dedication to learning.
